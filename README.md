# data_portfolio

I'm using this to keep track of my progress during the summer of 2025 as an aspiring Data Analyst.

## Goals
By September, I aim to:
- Be Proficient in Python for Data Analysis (pandas, seaborn, stats)
- Be confident with SQL (joins, aggregations, subqueries, etc.)
- Have 2â€“3 finished data projects uploaded to this repo
- Be more informed about choosing a particular specialisation, such as the data analysis sector or an adjacent role, e.g., product analyst, marketing analyst, RevOps, etc.
